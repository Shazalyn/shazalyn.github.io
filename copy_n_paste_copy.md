You have a bit of a headache from the kick-off party at the Tiki bar last night. Grab an aspirin from the Besties purse.
OOPS — That wasn’t aspirin! 



Your long-time hair stylist has a last minute cancellation & offers extensions at co$t. MERMAID HAIR here I come !!!

You are rockin’ the on trend red 80’s crop T you scored from the swap meet at the Rose Bowl, paired with the  ultimate hip hugger denim shorts. OMG-your male dopplegänger just strolled by in EXACTLY the same outfit :\
